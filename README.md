[EUROSENTIMETN Simple example with Reddit](http://eurosentiment-reddit.herokuapp.com) 
=========================================
In this simple example we show how to use the EUROSENTIMENT services to perform sentiment analysis on Reddit comments.
It also lists the top submissions on a subreddit (going to /r/{subredit} manually).
By default, it shows submissions to /r/python.

Although this application does not show the full potential of the portal, it can get you started with building your own service or application.

It is built using Flask and Request, and can be easily deployed to a PaaS such as Heroku.
You can see it working here:
